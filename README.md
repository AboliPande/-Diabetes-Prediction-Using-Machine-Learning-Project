# -Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Project

Overall Description:

The code aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict diabetes based on a provided dataset. It follows a typical machine learning workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison. The code primarily utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels for these tasks.

Detailed Breakdown:

Importing Libraries:

Imports necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn modules for data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Reading the Dataset:

Reads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file using Pandas. Displays the first few rows and examines the dataset's dimensions and information. 

EDA and Visualizations:

Performs exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables. Creates histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of individual features. Calculates descriptive statistics to summarize the data. Explores relationships between features and the target variable ('Outcome') using box plots and scatter plots. Computes and visualizes the correlation matrix to identify potential dependencies between variables. 

Clustering (Unsupervised Learning):
Attempts to find hidden patterns and relationships in the data using K-means clustering. Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. Assigns data points to clusters and visualizes the results using box plots. 

Data Preprocessing:

Missing Observation Analysis: Handles missing values in the dataset by replacing zeros with NaN and imputing them using the median values based on the 'Outcome' variable. 

Outlier Observation Analysis: Identifies and handles outliers using box plots and the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method. 

Feature Engineering:
Creates new features based on existing variables to potentially improve model performance. Categorizes BMI, Insulin, and Glucose levels into different groups. 

One-Hot Encoding:
Converts categorical features into numerical representations using one-hot encoding to prepare them for use in machine learning models. 

Scaling the Data:
Standardizes numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance. This helps improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms. 

Model Training and Evaluation:
Trains various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, using cross-validation to estimate their performance. Compares the models based on their accuracy scores and visualizes the results using box plots. 

Model Tuning:
Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal settings for Random Forest and XGBoost models, aiming to improve their performance. 

Comparison of Final Models:
Compares the performance of the tuned Random Forest and XGBoost models using cross-validation and visualizes the results using box plots. 

Reporting:
Summarizes the study's objectives, methodology, and findings. Highlights the best-performing model and its accuracy score.
